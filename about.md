Hi folks,

I'm a developer from somewhere in Vietnam, as you can see above ðŸ˜‚! This is our blog created with Github Pages. I decide to cancel all of my former blogs and use only this one to blogging. This blog is mainly my personal note when I learn somethings new, I want to review what I learned and share with other.

Update: I currently learning Elixir ðŸ’ª

### What I do

Currently I'm mainly a WordPress developer, I develop solution for SMB and blogger who don't have technical skill and can't manage WordPress blog by themselves. Our themes focus on speed, reliable, microdata and SEO. In addition, I'm General Translation Editor of WordPress tiáº¿ng Viá»‡t, I contribute translations and help others translate WordPress into Vietnamese.
