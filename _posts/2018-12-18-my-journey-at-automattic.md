title: My journey at Automattic
---

Today is a sad day for me. I received an email from the Happiness Hiring team said I didn't pass the second interview. The reason why I failed is my English fluency; it doesn't meet their requirement. I want to improve my fluency to re-apply, so I start blogging again.

There are many blogs out there about applying to Automattic, so I'm not going to talk about the process again. Here are some notes from my first (failed) attempt, hope this helps:

* **Writing is the most important skill**: As you may know, the hiring process at Automattic is 100% text-based. It includes emails, text-based interview. Mistakes in your writing can make you fail (like me).

* **Attention to detail**: The smallest thing can be used to judge your work. Make sure you have triple checked or more before sending anything out.

* **Be patient**: You may receive the reply quick or slow, but you will eventually receive one. Everything takes time.

* **Get to know your (desired) company**: Automattic is different. It's better to know about it before you send out your cover letter or while you're waiting for the reply. Read the Automattic Creed, blogs, article, books. For books, I recommend "The Years Without Pants".

That's what I want to note about my hiring process. I'll edit this blog shortly when I re-apply to Automattic. My journey as an Enterprise Happiness Engineer is just at the beginning.
