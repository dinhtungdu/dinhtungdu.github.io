title: Create your own Elementor template library
---

Elementor has a great feature called Template Library which let user import predefined template by a single click. But it doesn't let us - the developers - include our template into that library (by default).

But now we can : ).

Thanks to [@davelavoie](https://github.com/davelavoie)Â for sharing his idea and allowing me to use it.

## How it work?

Elementor Template library is made from `Source`. Elementor create sources then registers them to use in the library.

Guess what? We can follow this approach just fine by creating our own source and register it.
